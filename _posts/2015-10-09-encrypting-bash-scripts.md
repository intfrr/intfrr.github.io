This article describes how to encrypt your bash scripts

# Overview

## What is Shc?

A generic shell script compiler. Shc takes a script, which is specified on the command line and produces C source code. The generated source code is then compiled and linked to produce a stripped binary executable.

The compiled binary will still be dependent on the shell specified in the first line of the shell code (i.e shebang) (i.e. #!/bin/sh), thus shc does not create com‚Äê pletely independent binaries.

shc itself is not a compiler such as cc, it rather encodes and encrypts a shell script and generates C source code with the added expiration capability. It then uses the system compiler to compile a stripped binary which behaves exactly like the original script. Upon execution, the compiled binary will decrypt and execute the code with the shell -c option.

### Examples

	shc -f test.bash -o test

# How to make this happen

According to

And then to
<a href="http://neurobin.github.io/shc/">http://neurobin.github.io/shc/</a>


## Setup

### Install
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install


or simply run the binary file provided, in bin/x32 or bin/x64 in terminal

	./shc options


### For Ubuntu



	sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:neurobin/ppa
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install shc


### Testing

`cd to test "directory"...`

Output binary file will be test. If no output file is specified by the -o option, then it will create an executable with .x extension by default

### Known bugs
The one (and I hope the only) limitation using shc is the _SC_ARG_MAX system configuration parameter. It limits the maximum length of the arguments to the exec function, limiting the maximum length of the runnable script of shc. !! - CHECK YOUR RESULTS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING - !!
